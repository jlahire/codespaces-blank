# Logo Setup Instructions

## Where to Add Your Logo

### 1. Create the logos folder
In your repository, create this folder structure:
```
Curahee-Aviation/
└── assets/
    └── images/
        └── logos/    ← Create this folder
```

### 2. Save your logo
- Save the Currahee Aviation logo as: `currahee-logo.png`
- Place it in: `Curahee-Aviation/assets/images/logos/`

### 3. File requirements
- **Format**: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- **Size**: Any size - the website auto-resizes it
- **Name**: Must be exactly `currahee-logo.png`

### 4. Result
Your logo will appear on all page headers:
- **Homepage**: Larger size (60px height)
- **Other pages**: Smaller size (50px height)
- **Mobile**: Automatically adjusts for smaller screens

## File Structure After Adding Logo

```
your-repository/
├── Curahee-Aviation/
│   └── assets/
│       └── images/
│           ├── logos/
│           │   └── currahee-logo.png  ← Your logo here
│           ├── carousel/
│           ├── aircraft/
│           └── videos/
└── (other files...)
```

## If Logo Doesn't Appear
- Check the file name is exactly `currahee-logo.png`
- Check it's in the right folder: `Curahee-Aviation/assets/images/logos/`
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub to update the site
- The logo will hide automatically if the file is missing (won't break the site)

That's it! Your logo will appear on all pages automatically.
